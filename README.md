Creating 3d graphing calculator using pygame

The 3-d graphing calculator will graph surfaces defined by z = f(x,y).
Use the arrow keys to rotate the surface, and 'w' and 's' to zoom in and out.

The 3-d graphing calculator uses linear algebra to project a surface onto the screen based on the direction that you are viewing the surface from.
It also traces the your line of sight and will not display parts of the surface that are blocked by parts in front of it.

(also includes a simple 2d graphing calculator)
