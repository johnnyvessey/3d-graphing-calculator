Creating 3d graphing calculator using pygame

The 3-d graphing calculator will graph surfaces defined by z = f(x,y).
Use the arrow keys to rotate the surface, and 'w' and 's' to zoom in and out.

The 3-d graphing calculator uses linear algebra to project a surface onto the screen based on the direction that you are viewing the surface from.

(also includes a simple 2d graphing calculator)
